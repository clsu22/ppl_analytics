# 05-12-2020 Week 2 meeting notes

### Members: Elena, Keith, Justin, Manuel, Clara, Robert and Thomas
### Time: 10:00am -10:30 am, Tuesday 

5 things are discussed:

1. February's performance was not influenced by the epidemic therefore we can use that for model building.
2. We are allowed to set up files and folders in sharepoint.
3. They feel good with the resume scanner tool.
4. After seeing the data loss process, 
- **Elena** pointed out that we could use profiles of employees who are in the same position and same industry from Linkedin as external data. But this is not feasible because we don't have their performance information. 
- **Keith** then added that we could grab information for Glentel employees who don't have resumes in order to increase the sample size. 
- **Varada** thought that the data is enough for us to get started. Using external data could be one option for further study.
- **Manuel** confirmed that we are going to include employees who have at least three month performance. 
- **Manuel** restated plan B that we could model low tenure in case the high performance model doesn't make sense. 
5. We will give them a proposal report (PDF) on this Friday and Glentel will give us feedback on Next Tuesday.
