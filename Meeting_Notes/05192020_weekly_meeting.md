# 05-19-2020 Week 3 meeting notes

### Members: Justin, Keith, Manuel, Clara, Robert and Thomas
### Time: 10:00am - 10:40 am, Tuesday 


0. Before main agenda 
- Justin: 
    - Got two sets of employee profiles from recruitment team that show skills they are looking for. 
    - Already uploaded them to Sharepoint
    - employee profiles are different across banners 


1. Feedback on proposal 
- overall good 
- Justion: 
    - checked the training size and ask about if updated Linkedin profiles are useful 
    - Linkedin profiles are downloaded in PDF format and saved in a separate folder

2. EDA review 
- Manuel: Most employees are in WW but most high performers are in WE -> why? Is hiring process different for different banner? DO you allocate more employees with better attributes to COSTCO?
- Keith: This makes sense. More competitions in mall while one-stop shop and more consistant sales in costco -> More high plateaus for costco employees, but even this costco employees have better performance. 

3. Base CountVectorizer Logistic model review 
- Varada: 
    - even a random classifier can perform better than this baseline model (i.e even you labal everything as low performer, the accuracy should be 75%)
    - should include n-grams (most important)
- Some common words should be removed 

4. Features 
- Varada: contury of education, ask for company categories 
- Keith: 
    - job hopping: avg length in companys -> will give clear definition 
    - will give a file containing all categories of companys (important) and a competitors list.
