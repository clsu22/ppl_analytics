## CONTRIBUTING.md

This document was adapted from the [Altair Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) <br/>

We welcome and value any input, feedback, bug reports, and contributions. In particular, we would especially value input on the effectiveness of our visualizations and/or next/alternate steps for our analyses. We would also appreciate additional Jupyter Lab/Notebook based examples that use the same datasets as our analyses. 

#### Contributing Examples

Please feel free to contact one of the collaborators should you have any questions, would like access to the repo, or to submit a visualization based on the dataset used in this app:
